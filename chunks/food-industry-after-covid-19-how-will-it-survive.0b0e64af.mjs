The food industry is one of the sectors that was severely affected by the pandemic because of closures and lockdowns that forced food and beverage businesses to shut down or at least eliminate dine-in services if they want to continue functioning. These measures changed the way business is done, with a marked shift towards take-out and delivery services. Food delivery app development became more popular with businesses that wanted to continue surviving and even thriving during the pandemic!\n\n### How COVID-19 changed things\nThe pandemic is changing the way the food and beverage industry behaves. To keep functioning, businesses had to adapt and implement known safety and working measures. Those that still offer dine-in made sure that social distancing is implemented. Some businesses functioned with a skeleton workforce to minimize over-crowding.\n\nCOVID-19 also changed consumer preferences. People who want to stay safe and prefer to buy from businesses that are safe. Many would prefer to order take-out, curbside pickup, or have their food delivered to their home. Food delivery app development can be helpful to businesses that want to continue serving their customers through a challenging time.\n\n### Why do you need a food delivery app even after the pandemic?\nYou might think that food delivery apps are only highly relevant during COVID-19, but they may even be more beneficial down the line.
